# PersonalWebsite
I am Phillip Mai. This is my Personal Website, used to link to employers to get a quick glimpse at who I am. I want to build this to have something nice and easy to show employers who are looking for personal websites, and this will also be a good starting project during my time learning HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
