            Hi! I'm Phillip Mai. I'm a 3rd year Computer Engineering student at University of California, San Diego (UCSD)!
            I'm currently looking for Summer 2025 Internships, as well as working to get more cool projects and skills under my belt.
            I love software development and programming, but as a hobby I also spend a lot of my free time learning about the computer hardware side of things too, 
            such as semiconductors and the chips that power the devices our software runs on. 
            Because of those interests, I'm starting to get into full-stack development, learning HTML/CSS/Javascript and the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.JS).
            I'm excited to build up my portfolio, adding more cool passion projects to show employers, as well as my friends and family!
            I'm also looking into software development more towards the hardware side of things, taking classes in Systems Programming and Embedded Systems.
            I think it would be amazing to be able to combine my academic interests in software development with my hobbies in computer hardware. Lastly, thank you for reading!
